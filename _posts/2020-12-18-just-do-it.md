Within Nike's font to portray its action of working in the sporting industry has used the Italicized Impact font a sans serif typeface created by Geoffrey Lee in 1965  with a swoosh to show Nike's main logo being the swoosh. This bold italisced font has been used to make the font stand out. The choice of the font being italisced gives me the impression of movement, as if the the font is running in the direction towards the right, like the sport running Nike is outpouring this sense of movement and the inclsuion of sport which its company evolves around.
